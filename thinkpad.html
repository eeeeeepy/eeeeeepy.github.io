<h1>Thinkpad wallpapers and OEM info</h1>

<p>I bought a Thinkpad 560Z, which happened to have the stock installation of
Windows 98 still intact. The installation was pretty messed up, but before
I reinstalled the OS, I took a HD image. In this ZIP archive are the
wallapapers and OEM info I found in there.</p>

<p>I'd love to upload the whole HD image, but due to personal data I don't want
to do that.</p>
